# Reflection

1. The most helpful aspect of the codeâ€™s structure was the
separation of the functions from the console.log outputs because it made it
 easy to read and add whatever I needed without getting in the way of the code.

2. The part that was confusing or took longer to understand was the
 mostreadBook function because at first I didnt realize that it had 
two seperate loops but, after I figured out that it had a null step in its loop
it clicked and I figured out the logic.
